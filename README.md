# Work Day Scheduler

This application helps you to plan your workday by assigning tasks to each hour throughout the day. 

## Usage
Click inside each hour to enter the task for that hour. When the task is entered, click the save button to save the task. The schedule is color coded according to the time of day. The current hour will be red, future hours will be green, and past hours will be gray. 

Upon returning to the page after saving tasks, the previously saved tasks will automatically reload. To change the task, simply click back into the text field and type your new task, and click save again to update.
